### Option Pricing using Black-Scholes & Monte Carlo Simulations
*	Made extensive use of the initial price of the underlying stock, strike price, expiry, interest rate, sigma volatility and the sum of simulation iterations; developed to value options with multiple sources of uncertainty and complicated features.
*	Simulated stochastic processes (Brownian motion) to determine the price of financial instruments.
